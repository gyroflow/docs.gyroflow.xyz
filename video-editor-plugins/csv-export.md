\- **Camera data** - contains original gyroscope and accelerometer data + integrated quaternions and euler angles. It can be exported to CSV, JSON, USD or JSX (which can be imported in Adobe After Effects by using File -> Run Script)\
\- **Full metadata** - contains original metadata as parsed from the source file, without any Gyroflow calculations\
\- **Parsed metadata** - contains metadata which is used by Gyroflow, and is already pre-calculated as needed by Gyroflow stabilization algorithms\
\- **Project file (with processed gyro data) -** is a project file + parsed metadata + synced timing info



### Gyroflow to CSV python script <a href="#gyroflow-to-csv" id="gyroflow-to-csv"></a>

Gyroflow to CSV by [EmberLightVFX](https://github.com/EmberLightVFX) can convert Gyroflow project files to a CSV format containing the camera motion. This can be imported in software such as Blackmagic Fusion, Nuke and Unreal Engine, and may be used for visual effects work.
