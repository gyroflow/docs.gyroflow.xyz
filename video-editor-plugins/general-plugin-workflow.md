# ðŸ’¡ General plugin workflow

Gyroflow is also available in the form of a video editor plugin. The main idea behind that is to stabilize the video directly inside the video editor working on the original video file, instead of rendering a stabilized video in the app and then importing it to the video editor.

Since Gyroflow supports a lot of different cameras and gyro sources, it's practically impossible to recreate all tools it offers (for example synchronization with optical flow) inside the plugin UI.&#x20;

Instead, the workflow starts inside the main Gyroflow app, where you load your video, lens profile, gyro data, you do all synchronization and parameters, but **instead of rendering - you export a project file** which includes all your parameters and gyro data**.** This can be easily done by [**Ctrl + S**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] shortcut, or using **Export -> Export project file (including gyro data).**

This exported project file is then loaded inside the Gyroflow plugin in the video editor and the plugin will process your pixels directly inside your NLE[^2] according to the gyro data and all your parameters, but without any transcoding, recompression or additional processing.&#x20;

This is especially important when working with RAW files (like BRAW or R3D), where you retain all your RAW controls like ISO, White Balance etc.
