### Using as a camera

If you're filming on your phone, it's best to use the app that records video and gyro (GyroCam or MotionCam) at the same time, it will be easier to synchronize.

If your phone has OIS (Optical image Stabilization) and it's not possible to disable it - it will interfere with stabilization results.

Gyroflow will not work if you had any internal stabilization enabled on your phone.

### Using as external gyro logger

If you want to record gyro data for use with an external camera, you'll have to figure out the [**ðŸ”€ IMU Orientation**](../../advanced-usage/imu-orientation-and-rotation.md), depending on the way you mounted the phone.
